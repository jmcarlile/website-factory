# Website Factory

This project is a full stack web solution which is absent of business logic.
It is meant to be replicated as the starting point for any new project.
In other words, it's an opinionated boilerplate for the entire infrastructure of a website.
It comes with provisions for deployment with no fuss.
The scope is for rapid prototyping of ideas, not enterprise solutions. 
However, it is built to be infinitely scalable. 

The frontend features include routing, page layouts, form controls, and responsiveness.
We use React and Material UI.
The backend server has functionality for API responses and websockets.
We use Python Django with REST framework.
The backend is also a full python computing engine capable of database maintenance, web scrappers, and machine learning.
We use Jupyter with pandas and plotly.
